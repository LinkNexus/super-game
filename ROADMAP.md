# Project Roadmap — The Super Game

**Deadline:** August 12 | **Start:** June 18 | **~8 weeks total**

The overall approach: local game first, then server, then multiplayer.

---

## Phase 1 — Local Game (now → ~July 15)

**Goal:** A complete, playable single-machine game with enemies, shooting, a boss, and collision.

### Levy

| # | Task | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| L1 | **Refactor `main.cpp` into proper files** | Split into `Game`, `Player`, `Bullet`, `Enemy`, `Boss` classes/structs in separate `.h/.cpp` files under `client/src/`. Fix the y-boundary bug on line 31 too. |
| L2 | **Bullet/projectile system** | Pool of bullets, fired on SPACE, move upward at fixed speed, destroyed off-screen. |
| L3 | **Enemy grid system** | 4–5 rows × 10 columns, two enemy types. Enemies move left/right and step down (Space Invaders pattern). Random enemy shoots down. |
| L4 | **AABB collision detection** | Bullet↔Enemy, Bullet↔Player (enemy bullets), Player↔Enemy. Must be reusable for Phase 2. |
| L5 | **Boss enemy** | Appears after clearing enemies. Has a health pool (e.g. 20 hits), shoots in patterns, moves horizontally. |
| L6 | **Game state machine** | States: `MENU → PLAYING → GAME_OVER / WIN`. Clean transitions, pause support. |
| L7 | **Score & player health system** | Points per kill, player has 3 lives. Reset on new game. |
| L8 | **`shared/` message structs skeleton** | Define `PlayerInput` and `GameState` structs in `shared/` (needed in Phase 2). No networking yet — just the data layout. |
| L8.5 | **GitLab CI/CD pipeline** | `.gitlab-ci.yml` that builds the client (debug + release) via the CMake presets on every push/MR. Needs `GIT_SUBMODULE_STRATEGY: recursive` (raylib is a submodule) and build-dir caching. Extend in Phase 2 with the server build + Docker image, and unit tests once the server-side logic exists. |

| # | Task | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| Ly1 | **Starfield background** | Render 100–200 white dots at varying speeds/sizes for a parallax feel. A simple `Star` struct array updated each frame — good first C++ exercise. |
| Ly2 | **Player ship sprite** | Load a texture with `LoadTexture()`, replace the triangle. Learn `DrawTextureEx` for rotation/scaling. |
| Ly3 | **Enemy sprites** (2 types + Boss) | Spritesheet or individual PNGs. Animate using frame counter (e.g. toggle frame every 30 ticks). |
| Ly4 | **HUD — score & lives display** | Draw score top-left, draw heart icons for lives. Use `DrawText`, `DrawTexture`. |
| Ly5 | **Boss health bar** | A red/gray rectangle at the top that shrinks as boss takes hits. Drawn only when boss is active. |
| Ly6 | **Explosion effect** | When enemy is destroyed: spawn 8–12 particles (colored rectangles/circles) that fly outward and fade. A `Particle` struct with position, velocity, lifetime — real C++ struct/array work. |

## Phase 2 — Networking (July 15 → ~August 5)

**Goal:** Two players on separate machines, server runs authoritative simulation. The client keeps a **local mode** (offline single-player) alongside the new online mode — one binary, mode chosen in the menu, both modes running the same shared simulation.

### Levy

| # | Task | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| L9 | **Add `server/` CMake target** | New `add_subdirectory(server)` in root `CMakeLists.txt`, headless binary (no Raylib). |
| L10 | **Integrate µWebSockets into server** | Add as git submodule under `vendor/`, wire into server's `CMakeLists.txt`. |
| L11 | **Shared authoritative game loop (`GameSim`)** | Entities currently mix sim data and render data (e.g. `Player` holds `position`/`lives` *and* `Texture2D`/`draw()`), and their update logic calls raylib directly (`IsKeyDown`, etc.). Migrate one entity at a time (`Bullet` → `Enemy` → `Player` → `Boss`, simplest first): move its state into a plain `SimState` struct in `shared/` and its update logic into `shared/` alongside it (consuming `PlayerInput`, no raylib), leaving only `Texture2D` + `draw()` on the client side. State and logic move together per entity — they can't be split into separate passes without duplicating state. End state: a headless `GameSim` (world state + `step(inputs, dt)`) that the server runs authoritatively at fixed 60 Hz, and that the client's local mode runs in-process — no duplicated logic. Headless sim = unit-testable → wire tests into the L8.5 CI pipeline. |
| L12 | **Network protocol** | Define the wire format: Client sends `PlayerInput` (keys bitmask + timestamp). Server broadcasts `GameState` (all positions, health, score) to all clients. Start with JSON, optimise to binary if needed. |
| L13 | **Client WebSocket integration** | Add a lightweight WS client to the client. Send input each tick, receive and apply state snapshot. |
| L13.5 | **Local/Online mode selection** | Menu entry to pick Local or Online play. Introduce a session layer: `LocalSession` (input → `GameSim::step()` in-process → draw) vs `OnlineSession` (input → send to server → apply received `GameState` → draw). The draw code renders whatever state it's handed, regardless of source. |
| L14 | **Lobby / join system** | Server accepts up to 2 connections. First client = Player 1 (blue), second = Player 2 (triangle). Reject further connections. |
| L15 | **Client-side interpolation** | Smooth rendering between received state snapshots to hide network jitter (lerp positions). |
| L16 | **Docker setup** | `Dockerfile` for the server binary. Test locally with `docker run`. |

### Lynce

| # | Task | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| Ly7 | **Player 2 visual** | Second ship sprite/color, mirrored or distinct from Player 1. |
| Ly8 | **Connection UI** | A simple "Connecting…" / "Waiting for player 2…" screen shown before the game starts. Draw text + a blinking dot animation. |
| Ly9 | **Sound integration** | `InitAudioDevice()`, load `.wav`/`.ogg` files for: shoot, explosion, boss hit, game over. Hook into game events. Implement a simple `AudioManager` (load once, play on demand). |
| Ly10 | **Score screen / Game Over screen** | Show final score, who won, "Press R to restart". Nice visual layout with text and maybe a simple animated border. |

## Phase 3 — Polish (August 5 → August 12)

**Goal:** Presentable, demo-ready, no loose ends.

### Levy

| # | Task | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| L17 | **Deploy server to VPS via Dokploy** | Push Docker image, configure Dokploy, get a public IP/domain. |
| L18 | **Stress test & fix desyncs** | Run two clients, simulate bad network (packet delay), fix any state drift or crash. |
| L19 | **Enemy bullet system on server** | Make sure enemy shooting is server-authoritative (not client-predicted). |

### Lynce

| # | Task | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| Ly11 | **Background music** | Loop a music track with `PlayMusicStream()`, fade in/out on menu vs gameplay. |
| Ly12 | **Screen shake on Boss hit** | Offset the camera/draw position by a small random amount for ~10 frames. Small effect, big polish. |
| Ly13 | **Menu screen** | Title "THE SUPER GAME", Play button, controls cheat sheet. |
| Ly14 | **Asset audit** | Make sure all assets load correctly on Windows and Mac (path separators, missing files). |
